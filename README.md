To compile the project, please clone HorizenLabs/HL_Zexe repo in a folder called "HL_Zexe" and put it in the folder that contains also this repo (they should be at the same level in the FS).
Then switch to "sig" branch in HL_Zexe and compile using cargo build.
You can then compile this project by using, again, cargo build.
